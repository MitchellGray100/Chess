# Chess
Terminal based chess game. (Intended to become an Android app with GUI)

As a small personal group project, we created a terminal based chess 
in Java that allows chess pieces to make valid moves, checks if the king 
is in check or checkmate, determines if a player is in stalemate, changes 
the piece scoreboard as the game goes on, checks if a piece is being 
protected and or protecting another piece, and has a custom AI that uses 
Minimax techniques.
