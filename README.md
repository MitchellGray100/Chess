JavaFX based Chess Game. 
It's chess

As a personal project, I created a representation of Chess in Java that allows chess pieces to 
make valid moves, checks if the king is in check or checkmate, determines if a player is in 
stalemate, changes the piece scoreboard as the game goes on, checks if a piece is being protected
and/or protecting another piece, and has a custom AI that uses MiniMax techniques. The project 
is displayed with JavaFX.

Yellow dots show the last piece to move and where that piece moved from.

The e4 knight will take c3 pawn to gain 1 point.

The AI uses the b1 knight to take the c3 knight to gain 3 points. Points balance out to 2:0.
