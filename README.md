JavaFX based Chess Game. 
It's chess

As a personal project, I created a representation of Chess in Java that allows chess pieces to 
make valid moves, checks if the king is in check or checkmate, determines if a player is in 
stalemate, changes the piece scoreboard as the game goes on, checks if a piece is being protected
and/or protecting another piece, and has a custom AI that uses MiniMax techniques. The project 
is displayed with JavaFX. Now Supports 1 Player (with AI) and 2 Player modes.
