# Chess
It's chess
(Backend-only so far. Intended to become Android app)

As a small personal group project, we created a back-end representation of chess in Java that allows chess pieces to make valid moves, checks if the king is in check or checkmate, determines if a player is in stalemate, changes the piece scoreboard as the game goes on, checks if a piece is being protected and or protecting another piece, and has a custom AI that uses MiniMax techniques.
