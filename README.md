# Chess
Terminal based chess game. (Intended to become an Android app with GUI)

As a personal group project, Jacob and I created a terminal based chess in Java 
that allows chess pieces to make valid moves, checks if the king is in check or 
checkmate, determines if a player is in stalemate, changes the piece scoreboard as
the game goes on, checks if a piece is being protected and or protecting another 
piece, and has a custom AI that uses Minimax techniques (On my GitHub above).
